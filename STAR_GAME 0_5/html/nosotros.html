				Nine years ago I wrote a blog post titled "If I made another Monkey Island" and it feels like there are some things I need to say.
				<br>
				<br>
				I can't remember the exact incident, but the day I wrote that I was feeling down about never being able to make another Monkey Island. I wrote it in a single afternoon, and it was not much more than a stream of thoughts. In the movie version, tears would have been pouring down my cheeks, but it wasn't the movie version so I was probably sipping coffee and eating a chocolate chip cookie.
				<br>
				<br>
				My point is these were not commandments handed down and etched in stone on a giant tablet. They were just random thoughts about a (then very unlikely) new Monkey Island game.
				<br>
				<br>
				None of these are promises or anything I owe anybody.	
				<br>
				<br>
				People talk a lot about Monkey Island 3a as if it was the game I would have made after Monkey Island 2 had I stayed at Lucasfilm.Here's the deal.
				<br>
				<br>
				Here's the deal.	
				<br>
				<br>
				The totality of that idea was "Guybrush chases the demon pirate LeChuck to hell and Stan is there." That's it. That's all it was.
				<br>
				<br>
				Games, movies, and books don't come out fully formed. They start as a morsel of an idea and then all the hard work begins.
				<br>
				<br>
				Roger Ebert had a great quote that I am constantly reminding myself of:
				<br>
				<br>
				"The muse visits during the act of creation, not before."
				<br>
				<br>
				Had I stayed at Lucasfilm I might have started with that idea, but by the time the game was done it would have been something completely different and better.
				<br>
				<br>
				And that is exactly what Return to Monkey Island is.
				<br>

						When Dave and I first got together to talk about Return to Monkey Island we had a nearly blank slate. We talked over ideas we'd had over the years including one of mine where Guybrush wakes up 3000 years in the future on a snowball Earth.

						<br>
						<br>
						We talked about my original "hell" idea but other Monkey Island games had already done much of that (by pure coincidence) and there was little point in rehashing it.
						<br>
						<br>
						The one thing I wanted to do was start the new game right where LeChuck's Revenge ended, and that became the one unmovable stone.
						<br>
						<br>
						I have made one pixel art game in my entire career and that was Thimbleweed Park. Monkey Island 1 and 2 weren't pixel art games. They were games using state-of-the-art tech and art. Monkey Island 1 was 16 color EGA and we jumped at the chance to upgrade it to 256 colors. Monkey Island 2 featured the magical wizardry of scanned art by Peter Chan and Steve Purcell and we lusted to keep pushing everything forward.
						<br>
						<br>
						If I had stayed and done Monkey Island 3 it wouldn't have looked like Monkey Island 2. We would have kept pushing forward, and Day of the Tentacle is a good example of that.

				I never liked the art in DotT. Technically and artistically it was fantastic, but I never liked the wacky Chuck Jones style. But that was Dave and Tim's game, not mine. They can do what they want and I completely supported that.
				<br>
				<br>
				Curse of Monkey Island also took a leap forward. It introduced us to a fully voiced and taller, lankier Guybrush with painted backgrounds that were all the rage in the late 90s. It was very much a game of its time.
				<br>
				<br>
				When Dave and I first started brainstorming Return to Monkey Island we talked about pixel art, but it didn't feel right. We didn't want to make a retro game. You can't read an article about Thimbleweed Park without it being called a "throwback game". I didn't want Return to Monkey Island to be just a throwback game, I wanted to keep moving Monkey Island forward because it's interesting, fun, and exciting. It's what the Monkey Island games have always done.
				<br>
				<br>
				I wanted the art in Return to Monkey Island to be provocative, shocking, and not what everyone was expecting. Rex is an amazing creative force and we have a team of incredible artists, animators, sound designers, programmers, and testers all pouring their souls into this game and it's beautiful to see, play, and listen to.
				<br>
				<br>
				The music Michael, Peter, and Clint are doing is equally amazing. It's not AdLib, Sound Blaster, or even Roland MT-32 music. Its stunning, interactive, and recorded live.
				<br>
				<br>
				Return to Monkey Island may not be the art style you wanted or were expecting but it's the art style I wanted.
				<br>
				<br>
				When I started this game my biggest fear was Disney wouldn't let me make the game I wanted to make but they have been wonderful to work with.
				<br>
				<br>
				It's ironic that the people who don't want me to make the game I want to make are some of the hard core Monkey Island fans. And that is what makes me sad about all the comments.
				<br>
				<br>
				Return to Monkey Island is an incredible rollercoaster. Get on and have some fun or stomp out of the amusement park because it's not exactly the rollercoaster you wanted.
				<br>
				<br>
				I hope you'll jump on with the rest of us.
				<br>
				<br>
				*Seventeen - The game would be the game I wanted to make. I don't want the pressure of trying to make the game you want me to make. I would vanish for long periods of time. I would not constantly keep you up-to-date or be feeding the hype-machine. I'd show stuff that excited me or amused me. If you let me do those things, you will love the game. That, I promise.
